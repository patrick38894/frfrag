TODO


-1) Make functions unary (for now)
    * Consider solving this problem just by using structs or currying
   
0) Fix mandelbrot.

1) Write pretty printer

2) Write comparison instances

3) Add GLFW test setup
4) Add Pipes control of uniforms
5) Add FRP primitives (Abstract uniforms into FRP vars)

6) Add shapes and regions
     Tests (outline and fill):
         Circle
         Square
         Triangle
         Regular polygon
         Area under a curve
         Intersection of circle and square            

7) More tests
     Light following mouse
     Fractal explorer (newton, mandel)
     Hyperbolic pong
     Water/rain/ripples
     Fire
     Starfield

8) Add combinators, e.g. lambda, application, 
    "Warp" - change underlying glFragcoord in all occurrances,
    "Tint" change color in all occurances

9) Add Stream functions for more abstract loops

10) Add Structs. Add GHC-Generic based struct coupling.

11) Add optimization - constant folding.

12) Clean up repo and refactor. Make all errors consistently handled.

Required libraries:
    pipes
    pipes-concurrency
    glfw-b (occupies same module namespace as glfw, 
            so may need to use ghc-pkg to select the right one)
    OpenGL

To test:
    Salient demos are in TestWin.hs,
    which needs to be compiled to an executable for the windowing code to run.

Required libraries:
    pipes
    pipes-concurrency
    glfw-b (occupies same module namespace as glfw, 
            so may need to use ghc-pkg to select the right one)
    OpenGL

To test:
    Salient demos are in TestWin.hs,
    which needs to be compiled to an executable for the windowing code to run.

    These tests the GLSL EDSL and pretty printer,
    GLFW boilerplate, and basic use of Pipes to coordinate concurrent programs.
